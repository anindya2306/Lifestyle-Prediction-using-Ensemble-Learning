# Lifestyle Prediction using Ensemble Learning

This repository contains the code and documentation for my project on predicting lifestyle status using ensemble learning techniques. The project involves the classification of tabular data to determine whether a person is leading a 'healthy' or 'unhealthy' lifestyle based on various contributing factors.

## Dataset and Problem Statement

The dataset comprises multiple factors associated with an individual's lifestyle. The goal of the project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a person's lifestyle is healthy or not. The training dataset consists of 25,920 rows, each indicating the lifestyle status as either 1 ('healthy') or 0 ('unhealthy'). The task is to train the model on this data and then predict the lifestyle status of the 6,480 individuals in the testing dataset.

## Approach

- Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the dataset.
- Rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing techniques were applied to enhance the quality of the data.
- A diverse ensemble of classifiers was developed to make accurate predictions.
- The model was evaluated using the F1 score, a suitable metric for imbalanced classification tasks.

## Achievements

I secured an impressive 22nd place in Summer Analytics Hackathon by delivering exceptional results. The model achieved an outstanding F1 score of 87.63% on the private leaderboard. This achievement underscores the effectiveness of the ensemble learning approach and the meticulous data preprocessing.
